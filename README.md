finunipolicy
=============

Finunipolicy queries publications from the Virta REST API by university, cleans the DOIs, and queries Altmetric API by DOI.

The _policy_ string in the name implies that I'm particularly interested to see how much the articles have gathered altmetrics via [policy documents](https://www.altmetric.com/blog/new-source-alert-policy-documents/).

See [Virta REST API](https://confluence.csc.fi/display/VIR/REST-lukurajapinta) (in Finnish)
